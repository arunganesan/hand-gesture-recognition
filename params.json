{"name":"Hand-gesture-recognition","body":"Recent times have witnessed a large explosion in data. Data visualization has emerged as a powerful technique for data analysis by leveraging human cognition and layout algorithms for quickly seeing patterns. Despite the growth in data visualizations, tools for interacting with the data have largely remained the keyboard and mouse. We hypothesize that by developing accessible and a\u000Bordable data interaction systems, we can gain more from data visualization analysis. In this project we focus on the gesture recognition aspect of this system.\r\n\r\nCheck out our [Wiki](https://github.com/arunganesan/hand-gesture-recognition/wiki/_pages) for more information.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact @arunganesan or @Chossing.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Recognizing hand gestures using the Kinect","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
