\section{Implementation}
* Use Kinect SDK to map the color pixel to depth pixel
* OpenCL
* GPU has lot cache hit. It's limited by memory bandwidth since for the processor unit to get objects the GPU memory will take hundreds of operations
* Show actual system picture here
\subsection{Refinements}
* Changing double to float saves a lot of space
* Use EC2
