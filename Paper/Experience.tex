\section{Experience}

In building the system, we have learned several lessons in building a practical machine learning system.

\textbf{Late-optimization.} Although our system is very time-sensitive, we found that it is not necessary to do optimization on one component while other components are not ready. We found that the best is to  develop quickly and do profiling to discover then bottleneck and optimize it. This saves us a lot of time in making unnecessary optimization.
