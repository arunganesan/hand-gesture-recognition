\section{Introduction}
Natural user interface (NUI) has been regarded as a new way for human to interactive with machines. Among numerous NUIs which include multi-touch screen, eye tracking and many others, hand gesture seems to be one promising candidate. In this paper, we design and evaluate a novel hand gesture recognition system to demonstrate how much farther we are away from a actual production-level system. The reader should be noticed that we do not claim hand gesture is THE way user interface, and in fact there are some limitations such as users may feel fatigues (in )
