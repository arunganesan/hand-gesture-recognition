\section{System Architecture}

There are three main stages to our system. First is acquiring training samples using a colored glove. Second is training a classifier on the samples. Third is live prediction and pooling. 

The approach is pixel-level classification, and future pooling. The motivation for pixel-level classification is the potential of parallelizing the task and using the GPU to achieve real-time prediction.
