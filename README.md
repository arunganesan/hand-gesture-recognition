#Hello World.
Arun and Michael
Kinect project. Hand gesture recognition. Data visualization. We would like to use color gloves for generating training data.

##Vertical mode:
  In vertical mode, the hands are very close to background, not sure if the depth features are good enough.

##Color labeling problem:
  There always seems to exist some noise the mapped depth image. Need understand why. Is depth image already unstable or is the problem of mapping.
  To evaluate the mapped labeling, need to seperate the two issues: mapping of depth->image, and color labeling.
